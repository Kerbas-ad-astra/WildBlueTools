1.2.0

Science System
- Added a new science system that lets you load experiments into the Coach containers, fly them to your stations and transfer them into a MOLE lab, and once completed, load them back into a Coach for transport back to Kerbin. The experiments have little to no transmit value, encouraging you to bring them home (or if you prefer, load them into an MPL). The new experiments can have many requirements such as orbiting specific planets at specific altitudes, various resources, minimum crew, and required parts. To give players an added challenge, you can optionally specify the percentage chance that an experiment will succeed. You even have the ability to run a specific part module once an experiment has met the prerequisites- that gives you the ability to provide custom benefits. Consult the wiki for more details.

1.1.5
- Adjusted Ore and XenonGas capacities to reflect stock resource volumes.
